**Project Description**
This project is a Flask-based **Forex Recommendation System** that acts as a decision-support tool for currency trading. It uses the TradingView Technical Analysis API to fetch real-time market data for various currency pairs and generates trading recommendations (BUY, SELL, or NEUTRAL) based on technical indicators. The recommendations are visualized as pie charts, making it easier for traders to interpret the signals.

The project is designed as the backend for a trading dashboard application called **tRadex**, which includes a frontend implemented using Angular.

### **Key Components**
1. **ForexAPI.py**  
   This file represents the core logic of the decision-support system. It:
   - Connects to the TradingView API for technical analysis.
   - Processes data for different currency pairs and intervals.
   - Provides actionable recommendations for traders (BUY, SELL, NEUTRAL).
   - Generates pie charts to visualize the distribution of recommendations.

2. **`/strategie` Directory**  
   This folder contains the implementation of the **frontend for tRadex**, developed using Angular. It includes components and services to create an interactive user interface for viewing recommendations and charts generated by the backend.
